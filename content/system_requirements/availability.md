## Availability
Availability is the measure of a system's operational time. It's the probability that the system is up and running, ready to perform its tasks at any given moment
### **Why it's Important:**
For most businesses, downtime translates directly to lost revenue, damaged reputation, and poor user trust. High availability is a core requirement for mission-critical systems.
### **Common Techniques:**
- **Redundancy:** Eliminating single points of failure by having backup components (servers, databases, network links).
- **Automated Failover:** Automatically switching to a redundant component when a primary one fails.
- **Monitoring & Health Checks:** Continuously checking system health to detect and predict failures before they cause downtime.
