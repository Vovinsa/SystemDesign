## Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define the specific behaviors, functions, or services the system must be capable of performing. They are the "what" of the system. They describe the interactions between the system and its environment (users, other systems, etc.).
If a functional requirement is not met, the system has failed and is not fit for its purpose.
### **Key Characteristics:**
- **Action-oriented:** Usually described with verbs (e.g., "calculate," "display," "store," "process").
- **Specific and Verifiable:** They should be detailed enough to be tested. You can check if the system performs the function or not.
- **User-centric:** Directly relate to the tasks the user wants to accomplish.
