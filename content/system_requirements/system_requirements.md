## Introduction
In system design, system requirements are a formal description of the services a system must provide and the constraints under which it must operate. They define what the system should do and how it should do it. Establishing a clear, complete, and consistent set of requirements is arguably the most critical step in the system development lifecycle. Errors at this stage are the most expensive to fix later in the development process.
The primary goal of the requirements phase is to create an unambiguous agreement between the stakeholders (users, customers, developers) about what the system will do. These requirements serve as the foundation for design, implementation, and, most importantly, verification and validation.

## The Two Main Categories of System Requirements
- [Functional Requirements](functional_requirements)
- [Non-functional Requirements](non_functional_requirements.md)
### Why Requirements Matter
- **Guidance for Design:** They provide the blueprint for the system architects and designers.
- **Basis for Testing:** They form the basis for creating test cases for verification (Are we building the system right?) and validation (Are we building the right system?).
- **Project Scope Control:** A well-defined set of requirements helps prevent "scope creep"—the uncontrolled addition of new features.
- **Reduced Costs:** Catching a misunderstanding or error at the requirements stage is exponentially cheaper than fixing it after the system has been built.
In essence, a system without clear requirements is like a ship without a rudder—it may be well-built, but it has no clear direction and is unlikely to reach its intended destination.
