## Non-Functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements, often called "quality attributes," define the constraints on _how_ the system should perform its functions. They describe the quality characteristics of the system, not its specific behaviors. NFRs are critical because they dictate the usability, reliability, and overall user experience.
If an NFR is not met, the system might still work, but it could be unusable, slow, insecure, or unreliable.
## **Key Characteristics:**
- **Quality-oriented:** Describe properties like performance, security, and reliability.
- **Broad Impact:** Often apply to the system as a whole rather than a single feature.
- **Measurable and Testable:** While harder to test than FRs, they should be defined in measurable terms (e.g., "response time must be less than 2 seconds").
### **Common Types:**
- [Availability](availability.md)
- [Fault Tolerance](fault_tolerance.md)
- [Scalability](scalability.md)
- [Performance](Performance.md)
- [Durability](durability.md)
- [Consistency](consistency.md)
